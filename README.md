# Use cases
1. For AI Researchers/Engineers who wants to check machine's GPU usage during training, tuning or running the model you can easily check by typing the keyword 'GPU'.
2. For non-technical users who want to know their CPU or RAM usage, Lion provides an easy way to do that.
3. For Gamets who are playing games that requires high GPU usage and the game doesn't provide an easy way to check it, you can check it by using Lion.
