# Lion
Lion is a PC app (Windows) that lets you check your GPU, CPU &amp; RAM info easily.

# Use cases
1. For AI Researchers/Engineers who wants to check machine's GPU usage during training, tuning or running the model you can easily check by typing the keyword 'GPU'.
2. For non-technical users who want to know their CPU or RAM usage, Lion provides an easy way to do that.
3. For Gamets who are playing games that requires high GPU usage and the game doesn't provide an easy way to check it, you can check it by using Lion.

# History
Lion is a modern refreshed look of it's predecessor Percy. Both are essentially the same thing but Lion carries on Percy's mission but better
